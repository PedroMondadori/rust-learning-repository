# Rust Learning Repository

Although this repository is titled after the last chapter of the book ["The Rust Programming Language"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html), it is also dedicated to my personal learning journey, following the book (also known as "The Rust Book"). It contains code examples, exercises, and notes that I have created while working through the book.


## About the Book

"The Rust Programming Language" is an authoritative guide to Rust, providing a comprehensive introduction to the language's syntax, features, and concepts. It covers a wide range of topics, including ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, error handling, concurrency, and more. The book is widely regarded as an excellent resource for learning Rust.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into chapters, with each chapter containing its own folder. Inside each chapter folder, you will find code examples, exercises, and any additional notes or explanations that I have added. The structure of the repository closely follows the progression of the book, making it easy to navigate and follow along.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:


```
git clone https://github.com/PedroMondadori/rust-multithreaded-webserver
```

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can install Rust by following the instructions provided on the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
Usage

Each chapter folder contains separate Rust projects. You can navigate to a specific chapter and explore the code and exercises within it. Feel free to modify the code, experiment, and run the examples on your local machine.

To compile and run a Rust program, navigate to the project's folder using the command line and use the following command:

```
cargo run
```

This will build and execute the program using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system.
Contributions

As this repository is primarily intended for my personal learning, I am not actively seeking contributions. However, if you notice any errors, improvements, or have suggestions for clarification, you are welcome to open an issue or submit a pull request. I appreciate any feedback that can help enhance the learning experience.
